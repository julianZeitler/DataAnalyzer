Overview
=========
This program can be used to plot and then analyze data.
The data is given to the program over a `.mat` file. Examples of plots are shown below:

.. figure:: images/fig1.png
    :alt: Example fig1

    *Example figure 1 with standard plot types*

Properties like grid, axis labels and titles can all be set. It is possible to display multiple plots in one subplot.

.. figure:: images/fig2.png
    :alt: Example fig2

    *Example figure 2 with root regression*

The subplot division can be specified. In the second subplot a square root regression has been added.

.. figure:: images/fig3.png
    :alt: Example fig3

    *Example figure 3 polar plot*

Out of the box, the program supports two additional plot types:
Polar plots and histograms.

.. figure:: images/fig4.png
    :alt: Example fig4

    *Example figure 4 histogram*

Additional plot types can easily implemented, see developer guide.
