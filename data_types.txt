data types in Python:

Dictionary
	+ easy to convert to *.mat files

	- will propably become confusing at some point

Numpy array
	+ easy to use

	- like dictionary: will become very nested

Python data class (https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
	+ class syntax
	+ readability
	+ basically a dictionary with C struct syntax

	- needs to be converted to a ditctionary before it can be written to a *.mat file
	- converting dictionary to data class has a built-in function, however converting data class to dict is a little more unconvenient but also possible


Pandas data series (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dsintro)
	+ can be directly created from dictionary or ndarray (numpy)
	+ indexes can be assigned
	+ keys from dictionary automatically become indexes
	+ great compatibility with numpy

	- no class-like syntax

Pandas data frame (same link as above)
	+ 2D pandas data series
	+ readability
	+ can be converted to *.mat and back with a few steps (https://www.kaggle.com/avilesmarcel/open-mat-in-python-pandas-dataframe)
